                <p>C418 is the stage name of Daniel Rosenfeld. Daniel was born in Eastern Germany in 1989. He first learned to use a computer at the age of 5, and by his mid teens, started releasing his music on Bandcamp.</p>
        
                <p>He occasionally uploaded music as a hobby until early 2019, when he began collaborating with Markus Persson on an internet forum. Markus was working on a little-known new game called "<i>Minecraft</i>" and needed help creating sound effects and background music.</p>
        
                <p>In 2010, <i>Minecraft</i> was released to the general public and exploded in popularity. Daniel was able to quit his job at an assembly line and work on creating music full-time.</p>

                <p>Daniel's music is prominently featured throughout <i>Minecraft</i>, which has grown from a small project Daniel and Markus worked on, to the best selling video game of all time. </p>

                <p>Daniel has since produced multiple albums, including music for the <i>Stranger Things</i> series and the imfamous browser game <i>Cookie Clicker</i>. </p>
